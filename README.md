# HTNPoRT

**Hypertension Population Risk Tool (HTNPoRT)**

**Background**: Hypertension is preventable, and models predicting hypertension lack use for individual and population health planning.

**Methods**: The Hypertension Population Risk Tool (HTNPoRT) was derived from 19,643 respondents aged 20-79 in the Canadian Health Measures Survey. Sex-specific logistic regression models were developed using 16 predictors, including 4 sociodemographics, 3 psychosocial measures, 2 health status indicators, 5 health behaviours, and 2 chronic conditions.

**Results**: The final HTNPoRT models were discriminating (men c-statistic: 0.86, women c-statistic: 0.88), and well-calibrated in the overall population (men observed v. predicted: 0.88%, women observed v. predicted: 1.47%) and nearly all equity-relevant subgroups (175 out of 177). Age, diabetes, and body mass index were the most influential predictors of hypertension in SHAP-derived risk profiles, while predictability of adiposity measures differed across sex.

**Conclusions**: The public and health policymakers can use the models and risk profiles of HTNPoRT to support planning and decision-making on addressing the hypertension burden.
